                        <p>I recently moved into a new apartment complex, and I've noticed that the
                            garbage disposal system is inadequate. The bins are too small, and they
                            fill up quickly, resulting in garbage spilling over onto the ground. This
                            is not only unsanitary but also unattractive. I would appreciate it if you
                            could look into upgrading the garbage disposal system to better serve the
                            residents.</p>

                        <p>I'm concerned about the safety of the garbage collectors in our neighborhood. The roads are
                            narrow and winding, and there have been several close calls between the garbage trucks and
                            oncoming traffic. I would suggest implementing measures to ensure the safety of the garbage
                            collectors, such as scheduling collections during off-peak hours or providing additional
                            training on navigating the area.</p>

                        <p>I've noticed that the garbage collectors have been throwing recyclables into the regular
                            garbage bins. This is not only wasteful but also harmful to the environment. I would
                            appreciate it if you could remind the garbage collectors of the importance of recycling and
                            provide them with proper training on how to sort recyclables from regular garbage.</p>
